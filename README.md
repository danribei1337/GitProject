# Udemy Challenges Repository

Welcome to my **Udemy Challenges** repository! 🚀  
This repository contains all the coding challenges and exercises I completed during my learning journey. It is publicly available for anyone who wants to follow along or learn from these examples.

Basically, I spend a significant part of my day querying in Snowflake and building Data Products using dbtCloud. While this has provided me with good experience, I've felt a bit stagnant in both my personal and technical development. To address this, I decided to revisit foundational concepts and tackle more advanced topics during the days. This repository serves as a space to document and showcase my progress (and discipline) as I work through challenges, improve my skills, and push my boundaries.
